# Sawtooth FAQ: Transaction Processing

<h2>Does a client send a transaction request to all the validators in the
network?</h2>

No, it would just need to send the batch to one validator, then that
validator will broadcast the batch to the rest of its peers. If the
validator is down, your connection attempt from the app would fail. The
app could have error handling to try again (in a retry loop) or try
another validator.

<h2>Does Sawtooth have a way to control what participants have access to what
assets in the business network and under what conditions?</h2>

Blockchains, including Sawtooth, can be deployed as permissioned
networks, wherein transactions are visible to the participants of the
permissioned network, but not visible to the general public.

## What transaction processors are required?

Just the Settings TP, `settings` . The Validator Registry TP,
`sawtooth_validator_registry` , is required if you use PoET.

## What does the Settings TP do?

The Settings TP provides on-chain configs to be applied to the Sawtooth
Validators, so that you can change operational parameters without
restarting the validators or the whole sawtooth network. Also, you could
write your own settings-tp, that stores the settings the same way but
enforces different rules on how they are updated.

## Is there an example where the Settings TP is used in another TP?

Yes. check out `sawtooth.identity.allowed_keys` in the Identity TP:
<https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/families/identity/sawtooth_identity/processor/handler.py>

## Can different Validator Nodes have different Transaction Processors running?

No. The set of TPs must be the same for all validator nodes in a
Sawtooth network. The TP versions must also match across nodes\--support
the same set of ops. This is so the transaction and state validation
will be successful.

## How do I support multiple versions of a Transaction Processor?

You have two choices:

-   A single TP can register itself to handle multiple versions. When
    the TP receives a transaction, it looks at the transaction\'s
    version field and decides how to handle it in the Apply() method.
-   Multiple TPs, each handling a specific version.

In any case, all nodes need to support the same set of versions for a
specific Transaction Family.

## How do I support multiple Transaction Families in a Transaction Processor?

This is usually not a preferred best practice. But if the functionality
of the different TFs are closely related, you can have a TP support
multiple TFs. Just have the TP register multiple TFs at startup, instead
of just one TF.

## How do I upgrade a transaction processor version?

Bump up the version number of the TP and register with the validator.
Submit transactions to the TP with the updated version number. If you
want to reuse the existing TP, then you\'ll need to stop the existing
one and register the new one.

## Can a Validator Node have multiple TPs (processes) running for the same TF?

Yes, one or more TPs, handling the same or different Transaction
Families, may be running and register with a validator. This is one way
to achieve parallelism. Another way to achieve parallelism is to write a
multi-threaded TP. The transactions are sent to transaction processors
supporting the same transaction family in a round-robin fashion.

## What are inputs and outputs in Sawtooth?

In a Sawtooth transaction, inputs list what are the inputs for the
transaction (what addresses the TP can read). Outputs list what are the
outputs for the transaction (what addresses the TP can modify). The
inputs and outputs lists are specific to a transaction. See
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html>

## Why use round-robin if the transaction processors are identical?

This is useful when the when the validator\'s parallel scheduler is
used. Multiple transactions can be processed in parallel when the
inputs/outputs do not conflict.

## Where do I deploy transaction processors?

Each validator node runs all transaction processors supported for the
Sawtooth network. Sawtooth includes features for asynchronously
deploying and upgrading the Transaction Processors. In a typical
deployment you will have multiple Transaction Processors.

<h2>What happens if a validator receives a transaction but does not have a TP
for it?</h2>

If a validator receives a transaction that it does not have a
transaction processor for, the validator will wait until a TP connects
that can handle that transaction. The validator will stay online and
participate with the network and other services, but it will not be able
to validate transactions for which it does not have the associated
Transaction Processor. That validator would fall behind the rest on the
network while it waits. Hence it will not update state for any state
transitions that include or depend on such transactions *until* the
transaction processor is deployed for that node. Once deployed on that
validator, the validator will be able to catch up with the network.

## How can I limit what Transaction Processors run on a Validator Node?

You can also limit which transactions are accepted on the network by
setting `sawtooth.validator.transaction_families` If that setting is not
set, all transaction processors are accepted. This setting is ignored in
dev-mode consensus.

## Where do transactions originate?

From the client. The client sends a transaction to a validator, in a
batch with one or more transactions. The transactions are sent to the
validator, via the REST API, for the validator to add to the blockchain.

## Can the same transaction appear in multiple blocks?

No. Each block has a unique set of transaction. A block is composed of
batches, which is composed of transactions. Each transaction has a
unique ID and appears only once in a blockchain. There may be, however,
differences in ordering of blocks at a validator due to scheduling,
transaction dependencies, etc.

## What mechanism prevents a rogue TP from operating and corrupting data?

The design is as such that rogue TPs can\'t harm legitimate TPs. When
you run a network of validators, each validator has to have same version
of TPs. If a rogue TP is modifying your TPs data, the same TP has to run
in the rest of the validators in the network, to be able to affect the
blockchain. The validator where the rogue TP is working will constantly
fail state validations(Merkle hashes will be different with rest of the
network). Hence, the bigger the validator network, the more robust it is
against such attacks.

<h2> What does this error mean: `processor | [... DEBUG executor] transaction
processors registered for processor type cryptomoji: 0.1?`</h2>

It means there is no transaction processor running for your transaction
family.

<h2>What does this error mean: `processor | { AuthorizationException: Tried to
  get unauthorized address ...` ?</h2>

It means a the transaction processor tried to access (get/put) a value
not in the list of inputs/outputs. This occurs when a client submits a
transaction with an inaccurate list of inputs/outputs.

Make sure the Sawtooth address is the correct length\--the address is 70
hex characters, which represent a 35 byte address (including the 6 hex
character or 3 byte Transaction Family prefix).

<h2>What does this error mean: `applicator->Apply errorState Get Authorization
error. Check transaction inputs.`</h2>

See the answer above.

<h2>If you have a large file to store, is it best to just record the file hash
and store the file offline?</h2>

It depends on your use case. Storing data off-chain has a big downside.
Although you can confirm it hasn\'t been tampered with with the on-chain
hash, there is nothing stopping the file from disappearing. Also, how do
you make sure everyone who needs the data can get to it?

<h2> If I register a transaction processor to one validator, does the
registration get transmitted to the other validators in a network?</h2>

No. Your transaction processor must be deployed to all validators. All
validators in a network must have the same set of transaction
processors.

## How do I add a transaction processor?

You just start it in for all the validator nodes. The TP needs to
connect to `tcp://localhost:4004` or, if you are using Docker,
`tcp://validator:4004`

## How do I restrict what transaction processors are allowed?

By default, any TP can be added to a node without special permission
(other than network access). To restrict what TPs can be added to a
validator, use `sawset proposal create` to set
`sawtooth.validator.transaction_families`. For details, see
`Configuring the List of Transaction Families` at
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/docker.html>

## How do I add events to the transaction processor?

In the TP code, call `context.add_event()`. This adds a an
application-specific event. In the client code (or other app for
listening), subscribe to the event. For details, see
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/events_and_transactions_receipts.html#events>

## What initial Sawtooth events are available?

Besides application-specific events, the Sawtooth default events are:

`sawtooth/commit-block`

:   Committed block information: block ID, number, sate root hash, and
    previous block ID

`sawtooth/state-delta`

:   All state changes that occurred for a block at a specific address

## How do I subscribe to Sawtooth events?

See the documentation at
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/app_developers_guide/event_subscriptions.html>
Here are examples in Python and Javascript:

-   <https://github.com/danintel/sawtooth-cookiejar/blob/master/events/events_client.py>
-   <https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/blob/master/ledger_sync/subscriber/index.js>

## How do I handle forks while subscribing to Sawtooth events?

If you get `fork_detected: true` in the `state_changes` object, you
delete or undo events labeled with the blocks that have been removed
from history. For example, if you added the events to a local database,
remove the rows labeled with the removed blocks. Then apply events
forward from the most recent common block.

## Why is the Apply method in the TP handler called twice?

That is by design. It can be called more than twice. For that reason,
the TP handler must be deterministic (have the same output results given
the same input).

## What does it mean to be deterministic?

Deterministic means the output never varies, given the same input. That
is,

-   serialization must be deterministic, meaning the encoding is always
    in the same order and always the same for the same data
-   timestamps cannot be generated by the TP as they chain (timestamps
    in a transaction from the client are OK as they don\'t change for a
    given transaction)
-   counters, likewise, generated by the TP are not allowed (but
    counters from the client are OK for a given transaction)

## Do Transaction Processors run off-chain or on-chain?

Sawtooth TPs run off-chain, as a process (or processes).

<h2> My TP throws an exception of type `InternalError`, but the `Apply` method
gets stuck in an endless loop</h2>

`InternalError` is supposed to be a transient error (some internal fault
like \'out of memory\' that is temporary), and may succeed if retried.
The validator retries the transaction with the TP and results in a loop.
If the transaction is invalid, you probably want to raise an
`InvalidTransaction` error instead. Bottom line&mdash;internal errors
are retried, and invalid transactions are not retried.

<h2> I get this error when I try to set some Sawtooth settings: `Chain head is
not set yet. Permit all`</h2>

This error has been seen when the directory or file ownerships are
wrong. Try setting ownership as follows:
`chown sawtooth:sawtooth /var/lib/sawtooth /var/lib/sawtooth/*` . Then
verify with `ls -la /var/lib/sawtooth` . This error has also been seen
because the Settings TP has not been started. Start with
`settings-tp -vv` . Another cause could be because there is no genesis
block.

## Does the Transaction Processor know the current Transaction ID?

Yes. It is available in the header. The transaction header_signature is
the Transaction ID.

## Can I run two different Transaction Processors on the same Sawtooth Network?

Yes, you can run any number of transaction families, for example, you
can r un the Seafood Supply Chain app and Bond Asset Settlement app on
the same network.

<h2> What happens if someone writes a fake Transaction Processor (with the same
name, version, and address space) that can access and modify state data?</h2>

The fake TP will cause the node to fork and it will be ignored by the
rest of the network.

## Why is there no timestamp in a transaction header or block?

Using timestamps in a distributed network is troublesome\--mostly due to
complex clock synchronization issues among peers. You could add a
timestamp in your transaction family\'s transaction payload.

Sawtooth stores a timestamp in the block if the network is setup to
inject BlockInfo transactions using the BlockInfo Transaction Family
(which is used for EVM compatibility). See:
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/transaction_family_specifications/blockinfo_transaction_family.html>

## Does Sawtooth allow multiple digital signatures on a single transaction?

In Sawtooth the \"batch\" is the atomic unit of change. This is a
collection of one or more individually signed transactions. You could
have multiple transactions, each signed by a different party, combined
in one batch. This would have a similar effect to what you are talking
about I think. You can also build whatever app logic you like. So you
can require transactions from multiple parties before an action is
taken. The individual transactions themselves have only one signer.

## What is the size limit for a Sawtooth transaction?

There is no size limit, barring any memory and storage limits for your
Sawtooth nodes.

If you don\'t want to write a large transaction, you can reference some
external source (and also save a checksum). The disadvantage of storing
data externally is it\'s not replicated across nodes and may be lost.

<h2> What does this message mean: `Did not respond to the ping, removing
transaction processor` ?</h2>

This is a message from the Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain\'s Validator.
A timeout occurred when the Validator was checking connections with all
the registered transaction processors. If a transaction processor does
not respond, it is removed from the list.

Some possible causes: the transaction processor (TP) died. Check that
the TP process is still running (check in the Docker container if you
are running docker). Check network connectivity if the TP is on another
host or another virtual machine. Check the message logs. Perhaps the TP
is \"frozen\" or hanging or has a bug. Add logging messages (using
`` LOGGER.info()` for Python or Rust log4rs `info!()``).  

## What does this message mean:`Block rejected due to state root hash mismatch`?

You have a transaction processor that implements some non-deterministic
behavior, such as generating a random number in a calculation, or a timestamp,
etc.

## What does this message mean:`Have not received a chain head from peers.`?

This message has been seen when a node is not running a needed transaction
processor. A new node needs to run all the transaction processors required for
all the supported transaction families in this Sawtooth blockchain network.  

## How do I debug a transaction processor?

One way is to add logging messages (using`LOGGER.info()` for Python or Rust
log4rs). and sprinkle your code with debug messages, such as
`LOGGER.info(\"Action = %s.\", action)]` in
Python (or another language you use for the TP). Start the transaction
processor with the `-vv` or `-vvv` flags and look for console output.

<h2> What does this message mean: `failing transaction ... since it isn't
required in the configuration` ?</h2>

It means you set the `sawtooth.validator.transaction_families` setting
with the Settings TP and did not include the TP name and version for the
transaction that failed. The fix is to add the TP name and version to
the setting.

<h2> I noticed that TPs on various nodes do not process transactions in the
same order. Why?</h2>

There is no guarantee of sequencing in terms of how different
transactions are submitted and executed by the TPs. When transactions
read or modify the same portions of state, the validator enforces
ordering correctness, even with parallel execution. That is because the
validator\'s scheduler understands the ordering relationship and needs
to apply each state transition to the context provided to the next
transaction\'s execution.

## What do `failed state root hash validation` errors mean?

You have something non-deterministic happening with your changes to
state. You should not do non-deterministic actions in your transaction
processor such as generating timestamps or random numbers. The
serialization must also be deterministic\--the data must always
serialize the same. You should log the contents of [entries]{.title-ref}
prior to setState calls in your transaction processor. There will likely
be a difference between the publishing and validation executions of the
transaction (they always need to be identical)
