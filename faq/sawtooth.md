## What is Sawtooth?

Hyperledger Sawtooth is a modular enterprise blockchain platform for
building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers. The design
philosophy targets keeping ledgers distributed and making smart
contracts safe, particularly for enterprise use. Hyperledger Sawtooth
includes a novel consensus algorithm, Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET),
which targets large distributed validator populations with minimal
resource consumption. No special hardware is required to run Sawtooth or
PoET.

## What is the difference between Hyperledger and Sawtooth?

-   Sawtooth (or Hyperledger Sawtooth) is a blockchain implementation
    initially contributed by Intel Corporation and now maintained by the
    Sawtooth community. Sawtooth does not have to be deployed on Intel
    hardware; however, Sawtooth does include the optional PoET consensus     module, which uses Intel SGX to provide an efficient, Byzantine     Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism that does not rely on expensive     and inefficient mining algorithms. See <https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth>
-   Hyperledger is a consortium that includes Sawtooth as well as other blockchain implementations. \"Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation\" See <https://www.hyperledger.org/>.

 

## What is the difference between Sawtooth, Sawtooth Lake, and Hyperledger Sawtooth?

Sawtooth Lake was Intel\'s original code name for its blockchain
research project, named after a lake in the Sawtooth Mountains of
central Idaho. After it was contributed to the Linux Foundation\'s
Hyperledger consortium, the name was changed to Hyperledger Sawtooth.
Sawtooth is just shorthand for Hyperledger Sawtooth and are the same
thing.

 

## What is the difference between Hyperledger Sawtooth and Hyperledger Fabric?

Hyperledger Sawtooth and Fabric are two independent implementations of a
blockchain under the Linux Foundation\'s Hyperledger Blockchain project.
Here are some differences:

-   Fabric\'s Smart Contract must be written in GoLang or Javascript.
    Sawtooth transaction processors can be written in multiple
    languages, such as Rust, Python, Go, or JavaScript. SDKs for other
    languages are being added
-   Fabric has \"endorsing peers\" and ordering services to pre-process
    transactions. Sawtooth has a validator that handles everything from
    validating the transactions and distributing the transaction to peer
    nodes
-   Fabric stores data in a leveldb or couchdb, with a separate ledger
    per channel. Sawtooth stores all data in a central lmdb database
    with each transaction family using a separate address prefix.
-   Fabric has multiple components, including Orderers, Peers, CAs,
    CouchDB, and Tools. Sawtooth has the Sawtooth Validator and a
    Transaction Processor for each Transaction Family. The Validator\'s
    REST API communicates with a client

Based on <https://www.skcript.com/svr/hyperledger-fabric-to-sawtooth>

 

## What differentiates Sawtooth from other blockchains?

This includes:

-   State agreement, which assures each node has
    cryptographically-verifiable, identical copies of the blockchain
-   novel Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, through PoET
-   Unpluggable consensus on-the-fly (without restarting)
-   Multi-language SDK support (Python, Go, Javascript, Rust, with more
    being added)
-   Parallel transaction processing

For more on Sawtooth differentiation and philosophy, see
<https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2016/11/02/meet-sawtooth-lake>

 

## Should I use Sawtooth or other blockchain software for my application?

You should look for existing blockchain platforms that will fit your use
case, sort them out by features, maturity (are they production ready?),
and community support. We hope Sawtooth fits your needs.

 

## How does a blockchain differ from a database?

-   A database has one master copy. A blockchain has multiple
    authoritative copies
-   A database can be changed after a commit. A blockchain\'s records
    are immutable and cannot be undone after a commit
-   A database must have a trusted central authority

 

## Does Sawtooth focus on developing blockchain solutions for sustainable fishing?

No. The Seafood Supply Chain application is a proof-of-concept. Sawtooth
is a general-purpose enterprise blockchain platform.

 

## What does an immutable blockchain mean?

It means that blocks already committed cannot be \"undone\" or deleted.
The block\'s transactions are in the blockchain forever. The only way to
undo a transaction is to add another transaction to reverse a previous
transaction. So if the value of `a=1` and a transaction sets `a=2`, the
only way to undo it is to set `a=1` again. However regardless of what
the current value of `a` is, all three of those transactions are
permanently a part of the blockchain. The record of them will never be
lost, and in fact you could rewind state to what it was in previous
blocks if you needed.

This is different from immutable variables. The difference is that with
blockchain *transactions* are immutable. With some programming languages
(such as Rust), *variables* are immutable.

 

## How do I tell what version of Sawtooth is running?

```sh
$ sawtooth --version
sawtooth-cli (Hyperledger Sawtooth) version 1.1.2
```

 

## What\'s the difference between the `sawtooth`, `sawadm`, `sawnet`, and `sawset` commands?

`sawadm`

:   Administration tasks such as creating the genesis batch file or
    validator key generation

`sawnet`

:   Interact with Sawtooth network, such as comparing chains across
    nodes

`sawset`

:   Change genesis block settings or views, create, and vote on new
    block proposals

`sawtooth`

:   Interact with a Sawtooth validator, such as batches, blocks,
    identity, keygen, peers, settings, state, and transaction
    information

For more information, see the Sawtooth CLI Command Reference at
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/cli.html>

 

## Must software developed with Sawtooth be open source?

IANAL; however, Sawtooth is released under the Apache 2 license, a
permissive license, and so should be able to be used in both open and
closed source applications.

 

## Can I copy a Sawtooth Core source file to include with my project?

Yes, if you follow the Apache 2 license terms, which include requiring
preserving copyright and license notices. Sawtooth depends on other
runtime software that has separate terms.

 

## I get a usage error running `sawnet peers` or `sawnet list-blocks`

These commands were added after the Sawtooth 1.0.5 release and are not
available in earlier releases.

 

## How do I detect a forked blockchain in a Sawtooth network?

Use [sawnet compare-chains]{.title-ref} and look for a different set of
block(s) at the head of the chains. This is distinct from the case where
one node has a blockchain that\'s not up-to-date, but has conflicting
heads (\"forked\"). Forking can occur if the Sawtooth network is
partitioned and cannot fully communicate. It can also be the result of a
bug in transaction processing (for example, transactions don\'t
serialize in a deterministic way).

 

## What does `Failed to reach common ancestor` mean from `sawnet compare-chains`?

It means the blockchains have no blocks in common, including the genesis
block. This usually happens when a second node is added with its own
genesis node. Only the first node in a Sawtooth network should be
created with a genesis block.

 

## Does Hyperledger Composer support Sawtooth?

No. IBM has also reduced Composer development to maintenance mode. See:
<https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/composer/message/125>

 

## Does Hyperledger Explorer support Sawtooth?

No, not now. There is a Sawtooth Explorer at <https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-explorer> It may or may not be
merged with Hyperledger Explorer in the future. Sawtooth Explorer
provides visibility into the Sawtooth blockchain for node operators.

 

## How do I setup and use Sawtooth Explorer?

-   Install, configure, and run Hyperledger Sawtooth
-   Clone Sawtooth Explorer with
    `git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-explorer`
-   `cd sawtooth-explorer`
-   In file `docker/nginx.conf`, change `proxy_pass` to
    `http://localhost:8008`
-   In file `src/environments/environment.ts`, change `apiURL` to
    `http://<host-ip-address>:8090` (change to your hostname or IP
    address)
-   Start Sawtooth Explorer with `docker-compose up`
-   In a web browser, navigate to <http://>\<host-ip-address\>:8090
    (change to your hostname or IP address)
-   You can now see the transactions/batches that you submit from the
    client to Sawtooth in the Explorer user interface
-   More details are at
    <https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-explorer>

 

## How do I report a bug?

Use the JIRA bug tracking system at
<https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/STL/issues/STL-51?filter=allopenissues>
You need an account, which you create with the Linux foundation at
<https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/>, then login with that account.

 

## How do I report a security bug?

For security bugs only, send an email to <security@hyperledger.org>

 

## What encryption algorithms are used by Sawtooth?

-   Transaction signing with ECDSA 256-bit key using curve secp256k1
    (same as Bitcoin)
-   ZeroMQ (ZMQ or 0MQ) used for communications. ZMQ uses CurveZMQ for
    encryption and authentication, which uses ECDH 256-bit key with
    curve Curve25519 for key agreement.
-   PoET uses AES-GCM to encrypt its monotonic counter
-   Names are hashed with SHA-512 or SHA-256

 

## Can you explain Global State with an example?

Global state is where sawtooth and TPs read/write blockchain data.
Examples are a-plenty if you look at the github repo examples (intkey,
XO, etc.) The \"state\" is implemented as a Radix Merkle Trie over the
LMDB database, where the \'keys\' are 35 bytes (70 characters) and the
scheme for the keys is up to the TP developer. The first 3 bytes (6
chars) of the key identifies a unique TP namespace and it is recommended
to avoid colliding with other TP namespaces. To enable your TP to
read/write (or in context parlance \"get/set\") data at addresses, you
need to specify those addresses *a priori* in the Transaction
inputs/outputs. Otherwise you will get Authorization errors. The
addresses your TP will read or write to need to be deterministic.

Using the SimpleWallet application as an example (see example
application links above), the blockchain will contain transactions
showing deposits, withdrawals and transfers between accounts. The global
state will contain the balance in the different accounts corresponding
at the current point in time, after all transactions in the chain have
been processed.

 

## What is the difference between the Merkle Radix Trie and the blockchain?

The blockchain itself just stores transactions, not state, so reading
the data in the last block does not say much by itself. Data in the
blockchain is also immutable and can never change (except by adding new
blocks). The radix trie is a different data structure that is used to
make fast queries to the state. The root of the Merkle Trie is a hash.
One can easily identify if something changed when the root hash changes.
The Merkle Trie addressing allows quick retrieval at an address and
partial queries of address prefixes.

 

## Are 32-byte IDs within a transaction family large enough to avoid collisions?

Yes. If they are being generated with a random distribution, the chances
are vanishingly rare. A UUID is only 16-bytes and if you generated a
billion per second, it would take 100 years before you would expect 50%
odds of a collision.

 

## Why is Sawtooth capable of supporting large network populations of nodes?

One of the reasons is the homogeneous nature of Sawtooth Nodes. You
don\'t have different nodes with specialized functions, so it\'s easy to
setup and manage many nodes. Secondly, and more importantly, the PoET
consensus mechanism has been designed for large networks. It\'s not very
efficient in small networks and you\'ll likely get much better
performance with other mechanisms in a small network, but PoET handles
large populations easily.

 

## Is there a Sawtooth security evaluation?

Yes. This is a pre-1.0 release audit, that was required to be a part of
the Linux Foundation\'s Hyperledger project. See
<https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2018/05/22/hyperledger-sawtooth-security-audit>

 

## Are there any examples of Sawtooth permissions?

-   off-chain permissioning is in `/etc/sawtooth/validator.toml` (see
    `validator.toml.example` )
-   on-chaining permissioning is recorded on-chain. See block 0 for
    examples, such as `sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys`
-   transaction key permissioning controls what clients can submit
    transactions, based on signing keys
    (`transactor.transaction_signer`,
    `transaction.transaction_signer.<name of TP>`,
    `transactor.batch_signer` )
-   validation key permissioning controls what nodes are allowed to
    connect to the Sawtooth network
-   transaction family permissioning controls what TFs are supported by
    this Sawtooth network, `sawtooth.validator.transaction_families`
-   then there are policies and roles from the optional Sawtooth
    Identity Transaction Processor, documented at
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/transaction_family_specifications/identity_transaction_family.html>

 

## Does Sawtooth restore state when a peer restarts or when a peer is out-of-sync with the network?

Yes.

 

## When content at an address is changed several times by the transactions in a block, what appears in the state (Merkle Tree)?

The only thing that hits state is the aggregate (final) set of address
changes due to the transactions in the block. If multiple transactions
in a single block modify an address, there will only be one \'set\'. You
could see the transaction level changes in the receipts if you needed
to.

 

## In order to create a Sawtooth application, do I need to clone and modify the entire `sawtooth-core` repository?

No. It can be done that way, but it\'s not recommended. All you need to
write is the client application and the Transaction Processor. The core
Sawtooth functionality should be installed as packages instead of being
built from source and integrated with your application. Here\'s some
simple sample applications that are in standalone source repositories:

-   Simple Wallet, <https://github.com/askmish/sawtooth-simplewallet>
-   Cookie Jar, <https://github.com/danintel/sawtooth-cookiejar>
-   Cryptomoji, <https://github.com/hyperledger/education-cryptomoji> A
    self-paced course using a Cryptokitties clone written in Sawtooth
-   Simple Supply Chain,
    <https://github.com/hyperledger/education-sawtooth-simple-supply>
    This will be the example in a future edX.org course on Sawtooth app
    development

 

## What is Sawtooth *global state agreement*?

Sawtooth writes state to a verifiable structure called a *Radix Merkle
Trie* and the verification part (the root hash) is included in the
consensus process. That means that agreement is not just on the ordering
of transactions but also on the resulting contents of the entire
database.

This guards against a variety of possible failures during the
application of a transaction (e.g. different library version installed,
a write failure, a local database corruption, numerical representation
differences).

Of course the feature is mainly targeted at protecting the integrity of
a production network, but it is also helpful during development. Running
applications over test networks can help identify nondeterminism and
that will only be apparent if you form consensus over state.

 

## How can CPU vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown impact Sawtooth?

Sawtooth is a CPU-agnostic blockchain platform. It includes an optional
TEE/SGX feature which enhances BFT protections for PoET. PoET is
designed following a defense-in-depth approach. There are three or so
mechanisms that work in different aspects of the protocol independently
from the TEE. This includes three tests performed by PoET:

-   c-test: A node must wait c blocks after admission before its blocks
    will be accepted - this is to prevent trying to game identities and
    some obscure corner scenarios.
-   K-test: The node can publish at most K blocks before its peers
    require it to recertify itself.
-   z-test: And perhaps most importantly a node may not publish at
    frequency greater than z

Finally, should a node run a compromised consensus protocol, the main
characteristic at risk would be *fairness*. It would not be able to
impact *correctness* network-wide. That is, it cannot publish invalid
transactions. If it does the other nodes will just reject those
transactions and the associated block(s) and they will not commit
network-wide.

 

## Are Docker containers required to run Sawtooth?

Docker is a quick and easy way to get Sawtooth up and running. However,
unlike other Hyperledger ledgers, Sawtooth does not require Docker.
Follow the instructions to run on Ubuntu at
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/ubuntu.html>
For specific apps, you can run without docker by manually running
commands in a `Dockerfile` as follows:

-   Install Sawtooth on an Ubuntu following the instructions in the
    *Sawtooth Applications Developer\'s Guide*
-   Create the Genesis Block. See Guide in previous step
-   Install required packages listed under the RUN line in the
    `Dockerfile` for each container
-   Install your application\'s transaction processor and client.
-   Make sure your client app connects to the REST API at
    `http://localhost:8008` instead of `http://rest-api:8008`
-   Make sure your transaction processor connects to
    `tcp://localhost:4004` instead of `tcp://validator:4004`
-   Start the Validator, REST API, and Settings TP:

    `Dockerfile`)

 

## What cloud services support Sawtooth Blockchain?

AWS offers Sawtooth, and other cloud providers plan to offer Sawtooth on
their cloud service.

 

## Does Sawtooth support Ethereum?

Yes, through Seth, Sawtooth\'s Ethereum-compatible Transaction
Processor. It implements a Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) so Seth can
run Ethereum Dapps written in Solidity. Seth uses Hyperledger Burrow as
the code base.

 

## Does Sawtooth use blockchain mining?

No. There is no inherent need to incentivize miners in a
private/permissioned blockchain. Part of the permissioned model is that
everyone involved has a personal stake in the verifying the data, so you
do not need to pay them. This contrasts with a public deployment where
you are asking strangers to verify the data for you. In that case you
probably do need to incentivize them somehow, and a currency is a common
way to do so.

 

## What is the \"head node\" or \"master node\" in Sawtooth?

Sawtooth has no concept of a \"head node\" or \"master node\". Once
multiple nodes are up and running, each node has the same genesis block
(block 0) and treats all other nodes as peers. The first validator node
on the network has no special meaning, other than being the node that
created the genesis block.

 

## What is a Sawtooth Role?

A Role is a set if permissions. Identities could be assigned one or more
roles. A role is a convenient shorthand because role(s) can be assigned
to several identities rather than tediously assigning individual
permissions to each identity. See
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sysadmin_guide/configuring_permissions.html>
