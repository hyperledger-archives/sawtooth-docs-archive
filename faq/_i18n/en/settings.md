This is an unofficial list of some Transaction Family (TF) settings.
There is no central registry, most or all of these can be found on
github.

The following are some Sawtooth settings. Since Sawtooth settings are
extensible and include transaction family-specific settings, this list
is incomplete.

-   You can list existing settings with the
    `sawtooth settings list --url http://localhost:8008` command. For
    options, append `help` to the command.
-   You can set a setting with the
    `sawset proposal create --url http://localhost:8008` command. For
    example,
    `sawset proposal create --url http://localhost:8008 --key /etc/sawtooth/keys/validator.priv sawtooth.publisher.max_batches_per_block=200`
-   Some baseline settings are documented at
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html>
-   Transactor settings are documented at
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sysadmin_guide/configuring_permissions.html>
    and at
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html>
-   PoET settings are documented at
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/sysadmin_guide/configure_sgx.html>
-   Validator settings are documented at
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/architecture/injecting_batches_block_validation_rules.html#on-chain-validation-rules>
    and
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/architecture/injecting_batches_block_validation_rules.html#on-chain-configuration>

 

- **sawtooth.config.authorization_type**

  - Example setting\--never used. To set authorization type, use command
    line option `sawtooth-validator --network-auth {trust|challenge}`

- **sawtooth.consensus.algorithm.name**

  - Pluggable consensus algorithm name. These include `PoET`, `Devmode`,
    `raft`, and `pbft`. The default is `devmode` for Sawtooth 1.1 or
    earlier, with no default for the (unreleased) nightly build.

- **sawtooth.consensus.algorithm.version**

  - Consensus algorithm version. Currently 0.1 for PoET, Devmode, PBFT,
    and Raft.

- **sawtooth.consensus.block_validation_rules**

  - Lists validation rules to use in deciding what blocks to add to the
    blockchain. See
    <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/architecture/injecting_batches_block_validation_rules.html>

- **sawtooth.consensus.max_wait_time**

  - Maximum devmode consensus wait time, in seconds

- **sawtooth.consensus.min_wait_time**

  - Minimum devmode consensus wait time, in seconds

- **sawtooth.consensus.pbft.members**

  - JSON list of public keys belonging to each node that is a member of
    the PBFT network. Only required PBFT setting. 
  - Key is from
    `/etc/sawtooth/keys/validator.pub` . 
  - Example:
    `["0276f8fed116837eb7646f800e2dad6d13ad707055923e49df08f47a963547b631",\ "035d8d519a200cdb8085c62d6fb9f2678cf71cbde738101d61c4c8c2e9f2919aa"]`

  - For details on this and other PBFT settings, see
    <https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-pbft/blob/master/src/config.rs>

- **sawtooth.consensus.pbft.block_publishing_delay**

  - How often to try to publish a block. Optional, default 1000 ms.

- **sawtooth.consensus.pbft.idle_timeout**

  - How long to wait for the next (BlockNew + PrePrepare) before
    determining primary is faulty. Must be longer than
    block_publishing_delay. Optional, default 30000 ms

- **sawtooth.consensus.pbft.commit_timeout**

  - How long to wait (after Pre-Preparing) for the node to commit the
    block before starting a view change Optional, default 10000 ms

- **sawtooth.consensus.pbft.view_change_duration**

  - How long to wait for a valid `NewView` message before starting the
    next view change. If a node on view v starts a change to view (v +
    n), the timeout before starting a new change to view (v + n + 1)
    will be (n \* view_change_duration) Optional, default 5000 ms

- **sawtooth.consensus.pbft.forced_view_change_interval**

  - How many blocks to commit before forcing a view change for fairness
    Optional, default 100 blocks

- **sawtooth.consensus.raft.election_tick**

  - RAFT consensus election tick, in seconds. E.g., 1500

- **sawtooth.consensus.raft.heartbeat_tick**

  - RAFT consensus heartbeat tick, in seconds. E.g., 150

- **sawtooth.consensus.raft.peers**

  - JSON list of each peer node\'s public key. 
  - Only required RAFT setting. 
  - Key is from `/etc/sawtooth/keys/validator.pub` . 
  - Example:
    `["0276f8fed116837eb7646f800e2dad6d13ad707055923e49df08f47a963547b631",\ "035d8d519a200cdb8085c62d6fb9f2678cf71cbde738101d61c4c8c2e9f2919aa"]`

- **sawtooth.consensus.raft.period**

  - RAFT consensus period, in seconds. E.g., 3. Higher settings cause
    larger blocks, small settings have faster performance with smaller,
    quicker block publication, but causes more network traffic.

- **sawtooth.consensus.valid_block_publishers**

  - List of public keys for allowed block publishers. For devmode

- **sawtooth.gossip.time_to_live**

  - Expiration time for the Gossip node communication protocol

- **sawtooth.identity.allowed_keys**

  - List of keys allowed to make identity transactions to the identity TP

- **sawtooth.poet.enclave_module_name**

  - Python module name implementing the PoET enclave. Set to
    `sawtooth_poet_sgx.poet_enclave_sgx.poet_enclave`

- **sawtooth.poet.initial_wait_time**

  - For C Test: initial time to wait in seconds before proposing a block
    (e.g., 25; default is 3000)

- **sawtooth.poet.block_claim_delay**

  - For C Test: block claim delay in blocks. Set to 1 to prevent most
    reasonable attacks. Set to 2 or 3 if you want more aggressive
    protection. Default is 1.

- **sawtooth.poet.key_block_claim_limit**

  - For K Test: maximum number of blocks a validator may claim with a
    PoET keypair before it needs to refresh its signup information. I
    recommend bumping up so each key is good for 100000 blocks. A big
    number reduces the likelihood that validator keys will expire
    simultaneously and deadlock the network. Default is 250

- **sawtooth.poet.population_estimate_sample_size**

  - Sample size, in blocks, to compute the local mean wait time (default
    50). The local mean wait time multiplied by random_float(0,1) yields
    the PoET duration time. For production, we recommend 500 to get
    stable population estimates. Most enterprise networks have stable
    populations and so a long sample length is preferable.

- **sawtooth.poet.report_public_key_pem**

  - Public key used by Validator Registry TP to verify attestation
    reports. From `/etc/sawtooth/ias_rk_pub.pem` or (for PoET CFT)
    `/etc/sawtooth/simulator_rk_pub.pem`

- **sawtooth.poet.target_wait_time**

  - Target time to wait in seconds before proposing a block (e.g., 5;
    default 20)

- **sawtooth.poet.valid_enclave_basenames**

  - Adds the enclave basename for your enclave to the blockchain for the
    validator registry transaction processor to use to check signup
    information. From `poet enclave --enclave-module sgx basename`

- **sawtooth.poet.valid_enclave_measurements**

  - Adds the enclave measurement for your enclave to the blockchain for
    the validator registry transaction processor to use to check signup
    information. From `poet enclave --enclave-module sgx measurement` or
    (for PoET CFT) `poet enclave measurement`

- **sawtooth.poet.ztest_minimum_win_count**

  - For Z Test: minimum win count, to test a node is not winning too
    frequently. For test networks, disable by setting to 999999999,
    which gives you several decades before the Z test kicks in (16
    years \* 5 validators @ 30 seconds/block). This test is meant to
    catch rogue validators who have broken their enclave and are
    publishing too frequently. The Z Test doesn\'t work on small
    networks because all validators publish often

- **sawtooth.publisher.max_batches_per_block**

  - Maximum batches allowed per block (e.g., 100)

- **sawtooth.settings.vote.approval_threshold**

  - Minimum number of votes required to accept or reject a proposal
    (default 1)

  - List of public keys for authorized voters for on-chain settings. The
    initial setting is in the Genesis Block, Block 0

- **sawtooth.settings.vote.proposals**

    `SettingCandidates` protobuf)

- **sawtooth.swa.administrators**

  - List of public keys for authorized administrators to create, change,
    or delete Sabre contract and namespace registries.

- **sawtooth.validator.batch_injectors**

  - Comma-separated list of batch injectors to load. Parsed by validator
    at beginning of block publishing for each block

- **sawtooth.validator.block_validation_rules**

  - On-chain validation rules; enforced by the block validator

- **sawtooth.validator.max_transactions_per_block**

  - Maximum transactions allowed per block

- **sawtooth.validator.transaction_families**

  - List of permitted transaction families. If not set, all transaction
    families are permitted. Example setting:
    `[{"family":"sawtooth_settings", "version":"1.0"}, {"family":"xo", "version":"1.0"}]`
    *Dan\'s ProTip*: `sawtooth_settings` is a required TF.
    `sawtooth_validator_registry` is required if you use PoET.

  - Public keys of authorized signers (of any kind, batch or
    transaction)

- **transactor.batch_signer**

  - Public keys of authorized batch signers

- **transactor.transaction_signer**
