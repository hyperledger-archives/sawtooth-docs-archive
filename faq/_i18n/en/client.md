## What is a Sawtooth Client?

- It is an application that communicates with the Sawtooth Validator,
usually using the REST API. The application is Transaction
Family-specific and may come in various forms, such as a CLI, BUI
(browser/web app), GUI, or background daemon. The client may be written
in any language supported by the Sawtooth SDK.

 

## What languages does the Sawtooth Client SDK support?

- JavaScript, Python 3, and Rust. Others are in the process of being
added: Java and C++. A SDK for Microsoft .NET is also available from  
<https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-dotnet> 

- One can also
interface directly to Sawtooth without a SDK. Multiple languages are
supported as different languages are more suited for different problem
spaces and developers tend to be more comfortable with some languages
more than others. See this chart of Sawtooth SDK support:  
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/sdk_table.html>

- For more information, see the Sawtooth SDK Reference at  
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/sdks.html>

 

## Does Sawtooth have a .NET SDK?

- Yes, there is a Sawtooth SDK for .NET Core described here:  
<https://tomislav.tech/2018-03-02-sawtooth-sdk-net-core/> 

- The source is
here:  
<https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-dotnet>

 

## When would you want to develop without the Sawtooth SDK?

- You should use the SDK whenever possible for your language. If your
preferred development language does not have a SDK, or if the SDK is
incomplete for something you need, then develop without a SDK. For
details, see
<https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/no_sdk.html>

 

## What does the client do to send a transaction?

- It encodes the TF-specific payload (which could be anything, but defined
by the TF) in Base64, signs the transaction using ECDSA with curve
secp256k1, and generates a deterministic state address.

 

## What is the nonce used for in the transaction header?

- A nonce is a one-time use number (never repeated). Typically a random
number is used for a nonce. A nonce in this case guarantees against
replay attacks by making transactions unique.

 

## What does this error mean:

- `validator | [... DEBUG signature_verifier] transaction signature invalid for txn: ...`?  
The client submitted a transaction with an invalid signature.

 

## What are the various batch\_statuses REST API result values?

-   `PENDING` - batch validation has started on this validator. This
    ends when the batch is either committed or invalidated
-   `COMMITTED` - batch is in the blockchain
-   `INVALID` - batch has recently been invalidated by this validator
    and is still in the invalid batch cache
-   `UNKNOWN` - batch is not in any of the above categories, it is not
    currently being validated by this validator, not in the blockchain,
    and not in this validator\'s invalid cache

 

## What does an INVALID batch status mean?

- I means the transaction batch was processed by the Transaction
Processor, but the TP marked it as invalid. The INVALID batch
information is not stored on the blockchain. Validators will keep a
local cache of invalid batch info around for awhile (I think 10
minutes), so clients can query it, but that data is ephemeral.

 

## What does it mean if a batch status result remains `PENDING`?

- It means processing has not completed on the batch. If it stays that
way, it means the transaction batch never reached the Transaction
Processor. The transaction remains in the validator queue waiting for
the TP to appear online. The TP may have died or may have never started.
Or the validator failed the PoET Z Test (z-tested out) because it was
winning too frequently.

 

## Can I use partial address prefixes (say the 6-character prefix) in a transaction\'s input or output list?

- Yes. You can use full addresses or partial addresses or empty (no
address). The full addresses are preferred as this allows the parallel
scheduler to process non-conflicting transactions in parallel.

 

## How do I debug a Sawtooth client?

-   Add debug messages (such as `print("Action = {}".format(action))` in
    Python).
-   Start the REST API with the `sawtooth-rest-api -vvv` for the most
    verbosity.
-   Set the trace parameter to true when calling method `Batch`. In
    Python: `batch_pb2.Batch(trace=True)` . This prints additional
    logging information in the Sawtooth REST API and Validator
    components.

 

## How do I delete or change a specific value in state?

- Use the `delete_state` in the SDK to delete a specific state variable.
The data will remain in previously-created blocks (which are immutable),
but will not be in the current blockchain state.

 

## How can a Sawtooth client access a validator on another machine?

- By default, the REST API listens to client requests on localhost
(127.0.0.1) and is not accessible from a client on another machine. To
change this, edit file /etc/sawtooth/rest\_api.toml\` (copy from
[rest\_api.toml.example]{.title-ref}) and add a line similar to:
`bind = ["10.1.1.2:8008"]` where you change `10.1.1.2` to your IP
address or hostname.

 

## How do I use the Rust SDK in MS Windows?

Colin McCullough (<https://github.com/colincmcc>) gives these steps:

1.  Download libzmq from <https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq> and compile
    from source using `cmake`. One option is to follow the steps in the
    `.appveyor.bat` file in the `sawtooth-zmq-0.8.2-dev5` folder,
    located in your `.crates` folder. It contains appropriate `cmake`
    and `msbuild` commands, which may save some time, rather than try to
    follow the INSTALL instructions that come with libzmq. Windows
    binaries stop after something around 4.04 and you need 4.2. I
    believe you also need to rename the built lib file from `libzmq.lib`
    to `zmq.lib`
2.  Download OpenSSl and install. A dependency `rust-openssl` states
    that it will autolocate your ssl installation, but that was not the
    case for me. You\'ll have to set the location as an environment
    variable
3.  Download the protobuf compiler, `protoc`, from
    <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases> and set in
    your path
4.  Set these environment variables `OPENSSL_DIR`, `LIBZMQ_INCLUDE_DIR`,
    `LIBZMQ_PREFIX`, `LIBZMQ_LIB_DIR`. Building may only require the
    `OPENSSL_DIR` and `LIBZMQ_PREFIX` to be set. If you run a build with
    an incorrect environment variable or you move the dependencies to
    another location, you must run `cargo clean` to reset the build
    environment. Rust will look to the old build environment for any
    environment variables rather than the currently set paths.
5.  After all of this I still faced a missing dll error. One of the
    dependencies needs `libzmq.dll` and will not look for it under any
    of those set variable locations. I put the file in the system32
    folder, which fixed the issue. Any input on what environment
    variable needs to be set would be helpful.

Until Rust and the RustSDK are a bit more mature, I still recommend
using a Docker container for development to avoid any MS Windows
troubles. You can reach me at <hello@colinmac.me> with any questions.
