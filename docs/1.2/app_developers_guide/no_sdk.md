# Development Without an SDK

Hyperledger Sawtooth provides SDKs in a variety of languages to handle a
great deal of complexity and simplify developing applications for this
platform. The recommended way to work with Sawtooth is through
one of these [SDKs]({%link docs/1.2/app_developers_guide/using_the_sdks.md %}).
However, if there is no SDK for your language of choice, if the SDK is
missing functionality, or if you want a deeper understanding of what is
going on underneath the hood, use this guide to learn how to develop a
Sawtooth application without the help of an SDK.


> **Note**
>
> This guide uses Python 3 for the code examples, because Python 3
> provides a concrete demonstration in a common, readable language. The
> information in these examples applies to almost any language. Note that
> actual Python development should typically use the
> [Python SDK]({%link docs/1.2/app_developers_guide/python_sdk.md %})
