                  Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise solution for building,
                  deploying, and running distributed ledgers (also called
                  blockchains). It provides an extremely modular and flexible
                  platform for implementing transaction-based updates to shared
                  state between untrusted parties coordinated by consensus algorithms.
